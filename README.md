# Electron Configuration âš›

Created out of boredom, a (hopefully) useful tool for chemistry classes. WIP, to be expanded. Created using Node.

## Prerequisites

- Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) ðŸ¤¯

## Usage

Follow these steps to run the program:

1. Clone this repository.<br>`$ git clone https://github.com/datejer/electron-config`
2. Run the `index.js` file.<br>`$ node index.js`
3. Done! ðŸŽ‰

The program accepts both names (`Aluminum`) of the elements as well as their symbols (`Al`), _NOT_ case sensitive. ðŸ˜Š
